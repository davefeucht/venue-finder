Requirements:

-Optimized for phone. People will be looking up venues near them when they are out looking for somewhere to go, not primarily at home on their computer.
-User should be allowed to choose the distance radius from a dropdown with options of 1, 3, 5, 10 km. This field should be required. 
-User should be allowed to enter a type of venue, i.e. 'Restaurant', 'Record shop', 'Bike shop'. This should be optional. If nothing is entered, all types of venues are searched.
-Options should be shown at the top of the window, with the list of the results shown below.
-If there are no results, it should give the user an indication that there are no results.
-A 'jump to top' button should be displayed which will return the user to the top of the page.
-Should display name, address and phone number of each venue result

Improvements:

-Not appending to the DOM in a forEach loop, but instead creating a new DIV, appending to it in a loop, and then appending the parent DIV to the DOM.
-Adding form submit upon hitting Enter key
-Displaying something like "no information available" if address, phone, etc are all empty
-Displaying a loading spinner or other indicator when results are loading
-Adding option to view 'tips' for each result
-Displaying how many people are checked in at the place currently
-Less technical error messages
-Make Client Key and Client Secret not readable in the JS source
